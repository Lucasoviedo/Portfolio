            <h3>Work experiencie</h3>
            <p>Since October 2021 to the date, I have been working as a Full Stack web developer
              in a Startup in my city, using React as main front-end tool
              , and Python, Node Js, Selenium, and JavaScript for the back-end.
              </p>
              <p>
              At the same time, I have played an important role in the direction of the project
              , making decisions and coordinating the developers' staff and the UX/UI designer, using agile methodologies and tools such as Jira and
               GitHub for code reviewing and versions managment.

            <h3>Studies</h3>
            <p>
            I am one step away from obtaining my university degree in Informatic Engineering,
             where I acquired most of the knowledge that I use in my professional development.
            </p>
            <p>
            In addition to this, I am a highly self-taught person, so I am always looking to learn new tools to improve my work,
             which means that I am constantly learning something new.
